       wgrib                             wgrib2

       -d all                            (no option needed)
       -d N                              -d N or -d N.M (for grib2 submessages)
       -bin -o FILE.BIN                  -bin FILE.BIN
       -text -o FILE.TXT                 -text FILE.TXT
       -ieee -o FILE.BIN                 -ieee FILE.BIN
       -grib -o FILE.GRIB                -grib FILE.GRIB
       -nh                               -no_header
       -h                                -header
       -verf (sets verf time flag)       -verf (write inventory with verf time)
       -s -verf                          -verf
       -PDS/-PDS10                       n/a, use -get_bytes
       -GDS/-GDS10                       n/a, use -get_bytes
       -ncep_opn/-ncep_rean              not needed
       -4yr                              not needed, -4yr is always set
       -ncep_ens                         n/a, not needed
       -p                                n/a
       -dwdgrib                          n/a, not needed

       -o                                not needed, syntax change
       -----                             -order ???? (grids are converted to we:sn order by default)
                                         use -order we:ns for GFS, nothing for NAM


Changed inventory format, different searches
The wgrib2 inventory has changed. The various grep/egreps will have to be changed to see if they are compatible with new inventory format

works:
            wgrib  FILE | grep ":HGT:" | wgrib -i  FILE -bin -o FILE.BIN
            wgrib2 FILE | grep ":HGT:" | wgrib2 -i FILE -bin FILE.BIN
            wgrib2 FILE -bin FILE.BIN -match ":HGT:"

works:
            wgrib -4yr FILE | grep ":d=2006081712:" | wgrib -i  FILE -bin -o FILE.BIN
            wgrib2 FILE | grep ":d=2006081712:" | wgrib2 -i  FILE -bin -o FILE.BIN
            wgrib2 -match ":d=2006081712:" FILE -bin -o FILE.BIN

wgrib2 uses a 4 digit year code.  Scripts using 2 digit years need to modified.

convert:
            wgrib  FILE | grep ":d=06081712:" | wgrib -i  FILE -bin -o FILE.BIN
            wgrib2 FILE | grep ":d=2006081712:" | wgrib2 -i  FILE -bin -o FILE.BIN
            wgrib2 -match ":d=2006081712:" FILE -bin FILE.BIN

wgrib2 doesn't print out kdps5 .. kpds7 which are not applicable to grib2.

convert:
            wgrib  FILE | grep "kpds5=7:kpds6=100:kpds7=500:" | wgrib -i  FILE -bin -o FILE.BIN
            wgrib2 -match ":HGT:" -match ":500 mb:" -bin FILE.BIN FILE

            Note: kpds5/6/7 are table dependent so using HGT/500 mb was more reliable.
